# CVAdapter
AI CV Optimizer is a Python-powered tool that takes a candidate’s PDF résumé (CV) and a job posting, then uses AI prompts to generate a new, tailored CV specifically optimized for the target position. It also provides a match score indicating how well the original CV aligns with the job requirements.
